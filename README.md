# OrangeHRM Manual Testing Project

## Overview
This project involves manual testing of the [OrangeHRM Demo Site](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/). It focuses on testing the **Login** functionality and the **Apply Leave** functionality, including the creation of decision table, test scenarios, detailed test cases, and bug reporting.

## Features
- **Project Details**
  - Comprehensive manual testing of login and apply leave functionalities.
- **Decision Table**
  - Logical decision-making scenarios for login and leave application processes.
- **Test Case Documentation**
  - Well-structured and detailed test cases for the functionalities under test.
- **Bug Tracking and Reporting**
  - Identification of issues with proper reproduction steps and severity levels.

## Test Scenarios
The following scenarios are covered in this project:

### Login Module
1. Verify successful login with valid credentials.
2. Verify error messages for invalid credentials.
3. Verify error messages for blank credentials.

### Apply Leave Module
1. Verify applying for leave with valid dates.
2. Verify error messages when applying for leave with invalid or overlapping dates.
3. Verify applying for leave with blank dates.

## Decision Table
The decision table outlines possible conditions and corresponding actions for login and apply leave functionalities. For example:
| Condition                  | Action                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Valid login credentials    | Login successfully       |
| Invalid login credentials  | Display error message    |
| Blank login credentials    | Display error message    |
| Valid leave dates          | Allow leave request      |
| Invalid leave dates        | Deny leave request       |
| Blank leave dates          | Deny leave request       |
